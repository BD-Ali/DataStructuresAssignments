# Data Structures Assignments

This repository contains solutions for two data structures assignments from my university course. Each assignment is organized in its own directory with source code, documentation and a README explaining the tasks.

- **assignment1** - Implements a dynamic array, linked list, AVL tree, and other foundational data structures. See `assignment1/README.md` for details and consult the PDF instructions in the same folder.
- **assignment2** - Explores skip lists and hash tables with various hash functions and collision resolution strategies. See `assignment2/README.md` for more information and the assignment instructions.

To compile and run the Java programs, navigate into the respective assignment directory and use `javac` with the provided `.java` files.
