# Assignment 1: Dynamic Arrays, Linked Lists & AVL Trees

This directory contains my solution to the first data structures assignment.

## Overview
- **Dynamic array** (`MyArray`, `MyDynamicSet`) – implements a resizable array supporting insert and delete operations.
- **Linked lists** – includes singly linked lists (`MyLinkedList`, `Link`), sorted lists (`MySortedArray`, `MySortedLinkedList`), and generic node definitions (`TreeNode`, `Product`).
- **AVL tree** (`MyAVLTree`) – a balanced binary search tree that maintains logarithmic height.
- Additional support classes are provided, such as `IntegrityStatement` and `Element`.

The assignment instructions are in [Data_Structure_2025_Assignment2.pdf](./Data_Structure_2025_Assignment2.pdf). Refer to this PDF for the complete problem description and submission requirements.

## How to compile and run
Navigate to this directory and use the `javac` compiler to compile the classes. For example:

```bash
javac *.java
```

Then run the specific class with:

```bash
java ClassName
```
